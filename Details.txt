  Transition & Animation

    Transition:
      CSS prop values getting changed from one value to a different value

        height: 100px; depending on an action height: 50px;
      
      Transition handles the state change in a specified way, Eg: smooth transition
    
    Transform:
      certain function in css which transform the element from from one state to another,

      Eg: scale, translate, rotate, skew
    
    Animation:
      Animation is similar to transition, but animation does not relay on a state/action like hover, visited

      Animation happens when the elements is mounted into the DOM( Browser view elements )
